Module 12 Assignment

# Outline
In this challenge the aim was to both scape titles and previews from a website and display weather data. 

Focusing on using the “Splinter” and “BeautifulSoup” library functions, data can be collected from website and displayed through “Pandas” for adequate analysis. Part one of the challenge requires the text elements from a HTML to be identified, allowing specific classes to be selected and displayed. Specifically, article titles and previews have been identified and respectively displayed in a data frame for ease of readability. 

Part two requires a table from a html to be transposed into VSCode, allowing further analysis to be undertaken. Similarly, table elements are drawn for the analysis and through matplotlib and numpy, tables and graphs can be constructed with the extracted data.
